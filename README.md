# Virtual Classroom using Servlet
I have developed a web application using Servlets and JSP. I have made use HTML,CSS in frontend and Servelet in the Backend. I have ade use of MYSQL database.
The app has two interfaces student and teacher.The teacher can create a classroom using a class code and view the class details.
The teacher can post new materials,assignments and grade the assignmants.
The Student user can join the classroom using the class code and upload the assignments and view the materials.
It is similar to Google Classroom.
